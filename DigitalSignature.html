            <h2>How do you sign with the electronic DNI?</h2>
            <p>When we talk about electronic signature through the electronic DNI, we are talking about a qualified electronic signature being made.</p>
            <p>This category of signature is the one that offers the greatest legal guarantees, with the same recognition as the handwritten signature,</p>
            <p>being defined according to the eIDAS Regulation as:</p>
            <p><em>"An advanced electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device and</em></p>
            <p><em>is based on a qualified electronic signature certificate."</em></p>
            <h2>1.- Comply with the requirements to sign with the electronic DNI</h2>
            <p>First of all, we will have to check if we meet the minimum technical hardware and software requirements for its use. In the case of</p>
            <p>the electronic DNI, it will be mandatory to have a smart card reader, which can be integrated into the keyboard or connected to the</p>
            <p>computer via USB or PCMCIA card.</p>
            
            <p>Regarding software, the electronic DNI is prepared for use from any operating system, supporting the following Internet browsers:</p>
            
            <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 6.0 or higher)</p>
            <p>Mozilla Firefox (version 1.5 or higher)</p>
            <p>If we are going to sign using a card reader, we will need a cryptographic module, which will be different depending on the operating</p>
            <p>system or browser, and the drivers of the reading device itself.</p>
            
            <h2>2.- Sign electronically from the application</h2>
            <p>For the signature operation itself, we will have to open the document to be signed through the software solution with which we are going</p>
            <p>to make said signature.</p>
            
            <p>The process for the execution of this signature step by step will vary depending on the tool that we are going to use. In the case of Viafirma,</p>
            <p>it is a very simple and intuitive procedure.</p>
            
            <p>In general, you will have to select the document, which can be consulted prior to the signature, and then proceed to it, for which we will be</p>
            <p>required to have the verification PIN of our electronic DNI. A code that is provided to us when we obtain it and that we can modify if we wish.</p>
            
            <p>As we can see, making the most of everything that the electronic DNI offers us only requires a few simple steps that can be carried out from</p>
            <p>practically any device and system.</p>
            
            <p>It is a way to save time, comfort and legal support for all citizens, who have access to government procedures, as well as the option of</p>
            <p>digitally signing documents with the help of specialized software, such as the one offered by Viafirma.</p>
