            <p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by</p>
            <p>making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures,</p>
            <p>and subroutines.</p>
            
            <p>It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages, with the latter including support for</p>
            <p>block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include</p>
            <p>the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966, and the publication of the influential "Go To Statement Considered Harmful"</p>
            <p>open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, who coined the term "structured programming".</p>
            
            <p>Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when</p>
            <p>exception handling has to be performed.</p>
            

            
            <h1 id = "objectOriented">Object Oriented Programming</h1>
            
            
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the</p>
            <p>form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>
            
            <p>A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this</p>
            <p>or self). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but</p>
            <p>the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.</p>
            
            <p>Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented</p>
            <p>programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented</p>
            <p>languages include: (list order based on TIOBE index) Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal,</p>
            <p>Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.</p>
