            <p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by</p>
            <p>making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures,</p>
            <p>and subroutines.</p>
            
            <p>It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages, with the latter including support for</p>
            <p>block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include</p>
            <p>the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966, and the publication of the influential "Go To Statement Considered Harmful"</p>
            <p>open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, who coined the term "structured programming".</p>
            
            <p>Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when</p>
            <p>exception handling has to be performed.</p>

            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career.</p>
            <p>OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmers educational career.</p>
