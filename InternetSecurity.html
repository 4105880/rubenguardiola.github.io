         <p>Internet security is a branch of computer security which comprises various security measures exercised for ensuring the security of transactions done online. In the process, the <strong>internet security prevents attacks</strong><br>
	 targeted at <em>browsers, network, operating systems</em>, and other applications. Today, businesses and governments are more concerned about safeguarding from Cyber attacks and malware programs that originate<br>
	 from the internet. The main aim of Internet security is to set up precise rules and regulations that <strong>can deflect attacks that arise from the Internet</strong>. Internet security relies on particular resources and criteria for<br>		 safeguarding the data that is communicated or transferred online. The safeguarding techniques include different kinds of encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Besides, the other features of a secure<br>
	 Web setup can include <em>firewalls</em> that <strong>prevent undesired traffic, and anti-spyware, anti-malware, and anti-virus programs that work from particular networks or devices to watch online traffic for malicious<br>
	 attachments</strong>.</p>
        
	 <p>One of the <em>best examples of the internet security scams is the internet security essentials</em> – a <strong>rogue security software behaving to protect the Windows computers against malware and viruses installs itself<br>
	 through the use of a trojan horse</strong>. The <em>fake antivirus program</em> <strong>affected Microsoft operating systems</strong> namely the Windows 9x, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It relates to the “FakeVimes” family<br>
		 of <strong>fake antivirus malware</strong>!</p>
	 
	 <p>Internet Security Essentials Alert is a <strong>fake program</strong> which is part of a scam chiefly devised to deceive the user into <em>paying money</em> for malware.</p>
		 
	 <p>Internet Security Essentials works like a <strong>rogue antivirus software</strong>. It <em>uses</em> the <strong>scare tactics and fakes</strong> the user into believing that it has an association with Windows in order to make the user pay for<br>
	 the malware/virus removal. The symptoms of Internet Security Essentials infection are pretty standard. When the computer gets the infection, the user will notice a <strong>fake home screen</strong>, which is made to look <em>as if it is<br>
	 a window within Windows</em>, as a system component. <strong>The fake interface will run phony system scans to deceive the user</strong>.</p>
		 
	 <p>The <strong>scan comes back with <em>details</em> of many threats</strong> found on the user computer which aren’t actually present. However, few <strong>fake malware/virus files are actually planted by the malicious Internet Security<br>
	 Essentials program</strong>. Thereafter, the user is <em>requested to click on a button that says “Remove all”</em>, but when the user tries doing it, the <strong>fake <em>Internet Security Essentials comes back</em> with a message asking the user<br>
	 to <em>pay for the full version</em> of its software to complete the malware cleaning process</strong>. The user is directed to a <em>false website</em> that alleges to be the company website of Internet Security Essentials, however, <strong>that’s<br>
	 just the payment site for the scam</strong>.</p>
