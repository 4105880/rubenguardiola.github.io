            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            
            <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal</p>
            <p>of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.</p>
            
            <p>The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page</p>
            <p>or web application, including:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>Natural information such as text, images, and sounds</li>
                  <li>code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.</li>
            </ul>
                  <h3>WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2</h3>
            <ul>
                  <li>WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008.</li>
                  <li>WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018.</li>
                  <li>WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be published in 2021.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All requirements (“success criteria”) from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1.</p>
            <p>All requirements in 2.0 and 2.1 will be included in 2.2. The wording of the 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria will be exactly the same in 2.2.</p>
            
            <p>There are additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1.</p>
            <p>The proposed new success criteria in 2.2 are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0.</strong></p>
            <p>And content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 will also conform to 2.1 and 2.0. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 should</p>
            <p>meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources</p>
            <p>and you don’t need to bother looking at 2.0.</p>
            
            <p>WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when</p>
            <p>developing or updating content or accessibility policies.</p>
            
            <h3>Who WCAG is for</h3>
            <p>WCAG is primarily intended for:</p>
            
            <ul>
                  <li>Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Web authoring tool developers</li>
                  <li>Web accessibility evaluation tool developers</li>
                  <li>Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Related resources are intended to meet the needs of many different people, including policy makers, managers, researchers, and others.</p>
            
            <p>WCAG is a technical standard, not an introduction to accessibility. For introductory material, see “Where should I start?” in the FAQ.</p>
