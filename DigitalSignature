            <h2>How do you sign with the electronic DNI?</h2>
            <p>When we talk about electronic signature through the electronic DNI, we are talking about a qualified electronic signature being made.</p>
            <p>This category of signature is the one that offers the greatest legal guarantees, with the same recognition as the handwritten signature,</p>
            <p>being defined according to the eIDAS Regulation as:</p>
            <p>"An advanced electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device and</p>
            <p>is based on a qualified electronic signature certificate."</p>

1.- Comply with the requirements to sign with the electronic DNI
First of all, we will have to check if we meet the minimum technical hardware and software requirements for its use. In the case of the electronic DNI, it will be mandatory to have a smart card reader, which can be integrated into the keyboard or connected to the computer via USB or PCMCIA card.

Regarding software, the electronic DNI is prepared for use from any operating system, supporting the following Internet browsers:

Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 6.0 or higher)
Mozilla Firefox (version 1.5 or higher)

If we are going to sign using a card reader, we will need a cryptographic module, which will be different depending on the operating system or browser, and the drivers of the reading device itself.

2.- Sign electronically from the application
For the signature operation itself, we will have to open the document to be signed through the software solution with which we are going to make said signature.

The process for the execution of this signature step by step will vary depending on the tool that we are going to use. In the case of Viafirma, it is a very simple and intuitive procedure.

In general, you will have to select the document, which can be consulted prior to the signature, and then proceed to it, for which we will be required to have the verification PIN of our electronic DNI. A code that is provided to us when we obtain it and that we can modify if we wish.

As we can see, making the most of everything that the electronic DNI offers us only requires a few simple steps that can be carried out from practically any device and system.

It is a way to save time, comfort and legal support for all citizens, who have access to government procedures, as well as the option of digitally signing documents with the help of specialized software, such as the one offered by Viafirma.
