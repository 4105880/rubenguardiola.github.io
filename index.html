         <p>Internet security is a branch of computer security which comprises various security measures exercised for ensuring the security of transactions done online. In the process, the <strong>internet security prevents attacks</strong><br>
	 targeted at <em>browsers, network, operating systems</em>, and other applications. Today, businesses and governments are more concerned about safeguarding from Cyber attacks and malware programs that originate<br>
	 from the internet. The main aim of Internet security is to set up precise rules and regulations that can deflect attacks that arise from the Internet. Internet security relies on particular resources and criteria for<br>		 safeguarding the data that is communicated or transferred online. The safeguarding techniques include different kinds of encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Besides, the other features of a secure<br>
	 Web setup can include firewalls that prevent undesired traffic, and anti-spyware, anti-malware, and anti-virus programs that work from particular networks or devices to watch online traffic for malicious<br>
	 attachments.</p>
        
	 <p>One of the best examples of the internet security scams is the internet security essentials – a rogue security software behaving to protect the Windows computers against malware and viruses installs itself<br>
	 through the use of a trojan horse. The fake antivirus program affected Microsoft operating systems namely the Windows 9x, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It relates to the “FakeVimes” family of<br>
	 fake antivirus malware!</p>
	 
	 <p>Internet Security Essentials Alert is a fake program which is part of a scam chiefly devised to deceive the user into paying money for malware.</p>
		 
	 <p>Internet Security Essentials works like a rogue antivirus software. It uses the scare tactics and fakes the user into believing that it has an association with Windows in order to make the user pay for<br>
	 the malware/virus removal. The symptoms of Internet Security Essentials infection are pretty standard. When the computer gets the infection, the user will notice a fake home screen, which is made to look as if it is<br>
	 a window within Windows, as a system component. The fake interface will run phony system scans to deceive the user.</p>
		 
	 <p>The scan comes back with details of many threats found on the user computer which aren’t actually present. However, few fake malware/virus files are actually planted by the malicious Internet Security<br>
	 Essentials program. Thereafter, the user is requested to click on a button that says “Remove all,” but when the user tries doing it, the fake Internet Security Essentials comes back with a message asking the user<br>
	 to pay for the full version of its software to complete the malware cleaning process. The user is directed to a false website that alleges to be the company website of Internet Security Essentials, however, that’s<br>
	 just the payment site for the scam.</p>
